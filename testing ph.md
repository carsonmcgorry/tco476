#### To test the pH level, you will need the meter and the **red bottle** of pH indicator.

1. Uncap the meter if it is capped.
2. Fill the meter with water. When filling the meter,
you should submerge the meter in the pool such that the water reaches your elbow.
This avoids surface contamination and ensures that the readings will be accurate.
3. Empty the meter to rinse it out and fill it up again the same way.
4. Carefully pour out excess water from the **right** cylinder to the
**top** fill marker on the side of the cylinder. Don’t worry about the left cylinder.
5. Using the red bottle, drip 5 drops of indicator into the right cylinder.
6. Cap the meter and mix the indicator by flipping the meter upside down
and back again several times until the mixture is even.
7. Hold the meter up to light and compare the color of the mixture to the
colored squares on the meter. Determine the pH value by matching the color to the closest
comparison. If you can’t tell, it might be a value in between two colors.
8. Record the reading in the logbook. Remember to sign your initials.

The ideal pH level is around 7.4, but should be kept within the 7.0-7.8 range.
