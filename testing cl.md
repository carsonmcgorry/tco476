#### To test the chlorine level, you will need the meter, the **brown** bottle of chlorine indicator, and the canister of white **DPD** powder.

1. Uncap the meter if it is capped.
2. Fill the meter with water. When filling the meter, you should
submerge the meter in the pool such that the water reaches your elbow.
This ensures that the readings will be accurate.
3. Empty the meter to rinse it out and fill it up again the same way.
4. Carefully pour out excess water from the **left** cylinder to the
**bottom** fill marker on the side of the cylinder. Donâ€™t worry about the right cylinder.
5. Open the canister of DPD powder. Using the blue scoop, pour two
scoops of powder in the right cylinder. The water should start turning pink.
6. Cap the meter and mix by flipping the meter upside down and back
again several times until the mixture is even.
7. Using the brown bottle, drip drops of the chlorine indicator into the
pink water one at a time, counting each drop and gently shaking the mixture after each one.
8. When the water is completely clear, divide the number of drops you added by 2
to get the parts per million of free chlorine.
9. Record the reading in the logbook. Remember to sign your initials.
